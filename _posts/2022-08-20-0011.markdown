[Interchain Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) is the name of a new feature launching for the [Cosmos Hub blockchain](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos) soon, which allows blockchains to share the security properties of other blockchains.

The presentation I gave at HackATOM was streamed live. Here is the recording
