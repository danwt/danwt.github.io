## [Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around)

Author David Marquet was a commander of nuclear submarines in the US navy. He took over command of the USS Santa Fe in 1999 and turned it from being one of the worst performing ships in the navy to the one the best. The book explains his leader-leader approach, which tries to make every member of a hierarchy into a leader responsible for the success of their own subtree. Thus, each leader is a leader of leaders. We really enjoyed this book because it pairs concrete advice with interesting anecdotes from the world of submarining, which we knew nothing about.

These are the principles of leader-leader that we took away

1. Make all positions about responsibility rather than privilege.
2. Specify goals, not methods. Resist the urge to specify 'how'.
3. Encourage self development.
4. Encourage informal information sharing.
5. Certify competence with tests.

The book is more to-the-point than other books in this genre, and very concrete.

Rating: 5/5.

## [The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27516.The_Brethren)

This account of the inner workings of the US Supreme Court in the early 70's is not a self help book and doesn't give any advice. I've included it here because it's a good read and I saw many parallels between legal work and software engineering.

The court releases statements called _opinions_ which set a precedent for lower courts to base decisions from. There are similarities with software: the law should not self contradict or allow loopholes. It should be robust to change. For example, medical advancements may (or may not) impact future abortion law and this must be accounted for by the supreme court members.

The book tells the story of the different personalities on the court, and their various ideologies and agendas. Some members are more pragmatic, while others are more principled. Some are career and politically driven, while others care more about legal scholarship, ethics, or helping particular groups of American society.

I gained a better appreciation for the amount of skill that some people have in influencing others. I came away thinking that some members of the court were highly influential and tactical, whatever their goals, while others were clumsier and less effective.

Rating: 4/5. 1 point lost due to the length. It's 500 pages and I think it could have been 400.
