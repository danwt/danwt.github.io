The Bank of England publishes articles on their website. ['Money creation in the modern economy'](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy) is an understandable 14 page explainer of how money creation works in practice today.

Questions for myself:
- What happens if the government cannot bad on its bond obligations?
    Is it like:
        Goverment looks like it cant pay
        Face price of bond goes down due to high risk
        Central bank buys loads of cheap bonds?
        Floods the market, which raises taxes? 
        Hmm...
    Alternatively, how does the government get into debt in the first place?
         


    The central bank basically does QE by buying bonds, 
- how do you encourage actual real investment instead of buying existing assets?
- why does more equality lead to more growth
    (velocity of money)
- why dont the asset rich necessarily invest?
- how do you actually trade to take advantage of the prediction 'assets will go up'?
- why does fascism tend to rise after inequality?
- why does the government need to pay back it's bonds/pay back the central bank?
- gary says
- who are the largest owners of government bonds? who is the goverment in debt to?
- gary says as inequality increases then interest rates go to zero
    (rent can only go up so much, but prices can go to infinity)


need to recap the central premise of 'how markets fail'
