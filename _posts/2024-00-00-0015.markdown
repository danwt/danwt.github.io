The Bank of England publishes articles on their website. ['Money creation in the modern economy'](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy) is an understandable 14 page explainer of how money creation works in practice today.

    Maybe: Mark Blyth, Michael Hudson, Jeffrey Sachs ("Mark Blyth (a self admitted social democrat) and Michael Hudson (a marxist) have consistently nailed it when it comes to macro medium term predictions. Even Jeffrey Sachs (a more conservative social democrat) in his later life has been pretty good)")

Questions for myself:
- What happens if the government cannot bad on its bond obligations?
    Is it like:
        Goverment looks like it cant pay
        Face price of bond goes down due to high risk
        Central bank buys loads of cheap bonds?
        Floods the market, which raises taxes? 
        Hmm...
    Alternatively, how does the government get into debt in the first place?
         


    The central bank basically does QE by buying bonds, 
- how do you encourage actual real investment instead of buying existing assets?
- why does more equality lead to more growth
    (velocity of money)
- why dont the asset rich necessarily invest?
- how do you actually trade to take advantage of the prediction 'assets will go up'?
- why does fascism tend to rise after inequality?
- why does the government need to pay back it's bonds/pay back the central bank?
- gary says
- who are the largest owners of government bonds? who is the goverment in debt to?
- gary says as inequality increases then interest rates go to zero
    (rent can only go up so much, but prices can go to infinity)
- how exactly do banks control interest rates?
    with QE! they are two sides of the same coin
- gary has a really good chapter: part 3 chapter 2, where explains the nitty gritty of rates
- gary said the great depression lead to ww2, find out more

interesting article from gary here
    https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/who-should-pay-covid-crisis/
    which actually says that traders dont think the government will ever repay the central bank
    also, the loan is from the government to itself, which  (distinction treasury/central bank/government)
    gary actually seems to support some level of MMT

need to recap the central premise of 'how markets fail'

diverging a bit mariana mazzucato - influencing labour
    she's the one who said 'nation is not like a household'
    but then proceeds to say governments can only borrow if the investment is successful

        The principle thesis is that agreements between rich and poor countries, involving but not limited to the Unholy Trinity: The IMF, World Bank and WTO, push a free trade agenda, which does not let poor countries develop their high technology (manufacturing) sectors. Poorer countries would be better of with tarrifs etc.
