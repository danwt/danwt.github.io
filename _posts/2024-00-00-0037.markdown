Biggest pain points
- Making changes to shared package/middleware code, in conjunction with terraform changes and multiple service
- When you deploy a new service version you want to see the diff, but how do you avoid a full repo diff? Can you do some kind of code walking to see the the changes in the repo directory? Can you only see the diff of downstream code? How would this work if you're deploying multiple directories with a make command?
- how to do safe rolllforward/backward
- various dev philosophies: feature environments, trunk based, feature flags
- reducing pr time/number of prs
- bottom up vs top down archicture, and major architectural mistakes
- monitoring, alarming, how to set the right alarms, how to avoid verbose instrumentation code
- on hiring and doing shit standard, and how that helps
- why you need a really well thought out error system from the get go
- explain the debacle with http codes logging people out etc
