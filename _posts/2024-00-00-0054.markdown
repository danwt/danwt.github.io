## 15 - Naught Coin

Use erc20 transferFrom (and approve).

## 16 - Preservation

It's a repeat of the delegatecall concept from an earlier challenge.

Use an attacking time zone library contract witht the same slot layout to change the owner field in the caller state in setFirstTime.

## 17 - Recovery

Contract addresses are deterministically calculable from the EOA nonce (or nonce of the factory contract) and creator address.

Calculate the address or find it on Etherscan and then call destroy().

## 18 - MagicNum

TODO: requires assembly

## 19 - Alien Codex

Underflow the array to wrap around and be able to access the owner. Solidity contracts have a maximum number of slots.

## 20 - Denial

The attacking contract should drain all the gas and cause a TX fail, by implementing receive implementing receive() .

Why can't you use revert() or require()? Because they are not bubbled up when using low level call().

## 21 - Shop

Implement Buyer::price to read the isSold variable and return a dynamic price.
