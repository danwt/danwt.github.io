I've had this paper on my to-read list for a while, apparently it made a splash in the transaction processing world. Google presents Percolator, a system that provides random concurrent access to a multi petabyte repository while maintaining invariants. Beware, the paper is from 2010, so I assume it is no longer state of the art.
