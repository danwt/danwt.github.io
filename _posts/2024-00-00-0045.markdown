- Completeness: if the prover is correct they'll eventually convince the verifier
- Soundness: the prover can only be convincing if they're correct
- Zero Knowledge: the verifier learns NOTHING about the solution

Circuit: TODO:

Snark:
- Succinct: proof is short (logarithmic in circuit size) and verifiable also in logarithm of circuit size

Circuit setup procedures: TODO:

Example snarks: Groth16, Plonk/Marlin, Bulletproofs, STARK, DARK
How are snarks used:
    CirC to build a dsl for writing snark provable stuff

How does the extractor adversary model work? (Knowledge soundness)

On how basic public key crypto works
    Alice chooses a large number pq, and e relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1)
        (how can she choose e fast?)
    She also chooses d, an inverse of e in the group of order (p-1)(q-1) 
    She makes pq, e, public
    Bob encodes his message M to get ciphertext C = M ^e mod pq
    Alice does C^d mod pq = M^ed mod pq
        Which returns M, because ed mod (p-1)(q-1) is 1
    TODO: understand the relation between pq and (p-1)(q-1) better, something with totient?
        (Eulers theoremÂ§)
