- Completeness: if the prover is correct they'll eventually convince the verifier
- Soundness: the prover can only be convincing if they're correct
- Zero Knowledge: the verifier learns NOTHING about the solution

Circuit: TODO:

Snark:
- Succinct: proof is short (logarithmic in circuit size) and verifiable also in logarithm of circuit size

Circuit setup procedures: TODO:

Example snarks: Groth16, Plonk/Marlin, Bulletproofs, STARK, DARK
How are snarks used:
    CirC to build a dsl for writing snark provable stuff

How does the extractor adversary model work? (Knowledge soundness)
