Consider a read/write register in a message passing model with discrete time. If R is the worst case time to perform READ and W is the worst case time to perform WRITE, and messages can take up to _d_ units of time to be delivered, then:

d <= R + W.

For contradiction suppose the opposite. If P0 WRITEs at t=0 and P1 READs at t=W then by R+W P1's READ has returned. P1 cannot in the worst case distinguish executions where P0 did WRITE(1) or WRITE(2) if R+W < d: contradiction.
