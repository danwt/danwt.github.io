DVD is a fun series of challenges to learn Solidity.

# Problem 1 - Unstoppable

Try to DOS the flash loan contract.

Hint 1. The requirements the lender contract puts on itself.
Hint 2. ERC4626 usage.
Hint 3. Assumptions on vault funds origin.

Solution: send 1 token to the vault. It will be break the assertion

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = totalAssets(); // DamnValuableToken assets belonging to the vault
if (convertToShares(totalSupply) != balanceBefore) revert InvalidBalance();
```

The assertion is that the amount of shares the vault owns of the DamnValuableToken exactly corresponds to it's funds. But if you send the vault funds directly, it doesn't have a corresponding share.

# Problem 2
