[Agoric](https://github.com/Agoric/) is a smart contract platform built for Javascript. In October 2021, Andrey Kupriyanov and I presented a talk on modelling parts of the platform in TLA+. The platform has protocol layers including a remote promise resolution layer and a distributed garbage collector.
